I thought it was interesting when a teacher referred to 'fanfiction' as a form of '[multiplatform storytelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmedia_storytelling)', because this was an aspect I had never considered until today. How can one tell a story over multiple platforms? They can use a mix of website with interactive multimedia, social media and also create real world interaction that ties back to the digital.

But fanfiction, it brings <del>hideous</del> novels like _Twilight_ to users through the internet as communities of fans get together and works like the original rendition of _Fifty Shades of Grey_ appear as a result.. and not only appear, but then are reincarnated as brand new novels and sold on the Market. You could say the same about [_The Mortal Instruments_](http://bellumina.wordpress.com/2012/03/14/049-why-i-have-a-problem-with-cassandra-clare-why-you-should-too/). Still, despite this, it allows the same story to be told through extending to different mediums. I wonder how you could really make a print novel interactive to the point that it would involve people on social media, Youtube and real life? Sounds like something the Japanese would do, actually. Or a plot from a Japanese anime...
