<h3>Project Synopsis</h3>
<p><em>The Lizzie Bennet Diaries (LBD)</em> is a interactive webseries and adaptation of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> written by Jane Austen and produced by Hank Green and Bernie Su, which was launched and began airing on the <em>LizzieBennet</em> Youtube channel on 9 April, 2012. Aside from Youtube, as a multi-platform project these videos were distributed via other social media networks from which additional content was also regularly updated between episodes.</p>

<p>The story of <em>LBD</em> has been modernised from the 1800s to fit our contemporary internet-centric context and also adapted into an American environment, rather than an English one, in order to relate better to their target audience and make better use of their environment. It was the first attempt to modernise a retelling of the story and produces many of the characters in a new light.</p>

<p><em>LBD</em> investigates the divide between contemporary values of building a career and women being both independent and successful in a male-dominated world, verses the more traditional 'American Dream' of having 'two point five kids and a white picket fence' (2.5WPF). <em>LBD</em> re-imagines and cleverly re-contextualises the story to make the audience consider how our societal values have changed greatly yet in some ways not changed at all, and also illustrates the differences in approach to solving problems and communicating between time periods.</p>

<p>The series also addresses a contemporary concern though, mainly that of privacy in a public online environment and its consequences, as several characters feel the negative effects of their actions in publishing works online, although there is a note of optimism also as several characters are inspired or gain employment over the course of this series as a result of these videos and often these videos are ultimately what create a better understanding between characters. Although the series is very Lizzie-centric, various psychological and social perspectives are presented as characters intrude or start their own Youtube channels to further progress the story.</p>

<p>I am a student of Interactive Multimedia, however this work engages with my interest in social media first and foremost, as a medium of storytelling, and piques my curiousity with this unique approach to creating a webseries through a series of vlogs. The effect is the series feels almost real, bridging the gap between fictional space and reality. This work also engages with me because I very much enjoy the original <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> by Jane Austen and its many flavours of adaptation, yet this has been the most fascinating and relatable version I have come across.</p>

<h3>Intended Audience</h3>

<p>As the storytelling is spread across a vast selection of social media, <em>LBD</em> seeks to engage a younger audience of viewers, ones that are more ingrained into and familiar with our technologically-centric world. Therefore <em>LBD</em> aims at an audience from as young as 16 to 30 years or older. Having the story mainly being told from the perspectives of the 'young ones' (20 year olds) reinforces this – adult personalities are generally portrayed by the characters with their own perception and biases colouring the portrayal.</p>

<p>Although there is no particularly adult themes, some situations portrayed and related to can involve some adult themes, yet the nature of Youtube is that it is public to people of all ages and walks of life with an internet connection and thus attempts to cater to all.</p>

<p>This work would appeal to anyone interested in multi-platform storytelling or those that are interested in adaptations of classical literature as it is both a new and fresh approach to creating web series, but a well-rounded adaptation of a classical text that would otherwise seem inappropriate.</p>

<p>As technology advances, <em>LBD</em> may no longer become as relevant because the social environment and technology have both changed, however the themes that we value are still relatable even though their meaning to us may change. Stories such as the classic text on which this project is based are said to transcend time and this series will continue to assist it as well as the other adaptions of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> in transcending time (Lizzie makes subtle references to the adaptation starring Colin Firth).</p>

<h3>Platform Choice</h3>

<p><em>LBD</em> is broadcasted largely though the online virtual space via Youtube in apparent 'real-time' (staged over time) by providing bi-weekly 'vlog' installments of around 2-8 minutes over the period of a year, and simultaneously regular interactions via Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr with distribution of Youtube videos via these channels. Clearly designed to be multiplatform from the start, these platforms serve to bring the story to life and thus engage with audiences on a different level, although requires a fairly good understanding and experience of these social networks. It is therefore not as accessible for older audience without this experience, however ultimately accessible to all, as these videos are public to all on the internet.</p>

<p>Due to being on Youtube and being in video form, although some videos have an HTML5 alternative, largely the project can be accessed from any computer that has Adobe Flash installed and an internet connection, however audiences can still engage with the project's other platforms from any telecommunications device such as their phone.</p>

<p>This online experience produces both an immersive and interactive experience that allows the user to follow the story and interact with the characters in it, but only during its run, as the story is presented as realistically as possible.</p>

<p>Although like the original text, Lizzie Bennet's Youtube channel allows the story to be told much like in the novel itself where we mainly get Lizzie's point of view, alternate Youtube channels and other forms of social media for her sister, Lydia Bennet; her friend, Charlotte Lu; Charlotte's little sister, Maria Lu; and two fictional companies, Pemberley Digital and Collins and Collins; from the story allow perspectives and insight into the lives of other characters while they are away from Lizzie. The characters' social media accounts also interact with each other and with their audience to keep their audience engaged and involved between episodes.</p>

<p><em>LBD</em> does not only appear online however but also brings itself to the real world, appearing at VidCon – a 'conference' for online video viewers and creators – where a few episodes were also filmed. This makes the series additionally location-based as there are also occasionally outside videos (mainly from Lydia Bennet's channel) that illustrate the outside world.</p>

<p><em>LBD</em> is at times a serious story, but also at times a comedic and fun story, having the unique aspects of 'costume theatre' to parody characters that do not appear on screen and an informal, relaxed and close atmosphere, but deals with some important themes and serious implications. Youtube is therefore a great platform for such an experience as it allows this to be delivered in just the right personal way.</p>

<p>DVDs of this webseries containing all the vlogs from the series are currently being released for purchase, however these would target those who have already watched the series, otherwise this would distract from the experience of it. Merchandise was also available throughout the series for purchase.</p>

<h3>Interactive Elements and Use of Social Media</h3>

<p>Although the nature of the video delivery means that the story is fairly linear and sequential, it is at the same time non-linear as it runs parallel with other Youtube channels covering their own branches of the story, not to forget the interactions over social media. There is a fusion of video footage, commentary, audience interaction through questions in the videos which makes for a fairly directed experience, but only if you do not explore the other Youtube channels available for the series.</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.assets }}/lizziebennet4.jpg" style="width:500px; height:auto;" alt="Lizzie Bennet Twitter" title="Lizzie Bennet Twitter" /></p>

<p>Due to the spread of the storytelling across so many social media channels, this allows many points of interaction. Not only can the audience get involved in the conversations between characters over social media but can produce their own unique content from the series, posting them up online for other fans of the series to enjoy and sometimes shared by characters themselves. Via Youtube's interface, viewers are able to also make comments, rate and share the video with their friends. <em>LBD</em> also make regular 'Questions and Answers' videos that will reply to the questions of their viewers while in character.</p>

<p>Other than being directly interactive, the audience is able to feel involvement in the storyline because Lizzie talks directly to us in her videos, and we are not only watching the story from a third-person perspective. The focus of the camera is often fixed, there is no panning or moving and entices audiences as characters enter and leave the frame naturally. There is a sense of reality and this creates an atmosphere of intimacy through the entire work although it is soon becomes aware to Lizzie that she is turning her private life into a very public spectacle. The series relates to real life events such as the university semester and VidCon.</p>

<p>Some of the videos are also quietly instructive to viewers, giving them tips as to how to make a good video interview and how to vlog, which creates a new avenue for interaction other than on an entertainment level.</p>

<p><img src="{{ site.assets }}/lizziebennet5.jpg" style="width:500px; height:auto;" alt="Collins and Collins Youtube Channel" title="Collins and Collins Youtube Channel" /></p>

<p>Given the intended audience of people that are more or less familiar with both social media and sites such as Youtube, this means it is fairly easy, smooth and intuitive to both find and navigate through the content, however it is understandably more complex and confusing for anyone who is not familiar and they may realistically fall to the assumption that this webseries is just something from real life.</p>

<p>Essentially although viewers are navigating through a fictional world with the assistance of the characters, we do not get the sense that any of it is unreal but that it is all too real. The line between real world and fictional world is further blurred when real events such as VidCon are brought in.</p>

<p>The series has a website that is not structured in the way as the rest of the content, but rather works as an archive and compilation of all the content and is a website not for the characters but the series as a while. This allows better navigation of the series if you are new to it.</p>

<p>My personal experience of the series was after its original run, however as the 'endcard' of each video allowed links backwards and forwards in the storyline as well as to any videos that were running parallel to Lizzie's this made the series easy to navigate. Although no direct interaction with characters is possible at this stage, the videos allowed me to completely immerse in the series and at the end be inspired to find out more and see what else had been presented over social networks – therefore I was able to find the postscript for the series and other subtle interactions that had happened over social media.</p>

<p>The Lizzie Bennet Diaries also won an 'Interactive Media Emmy' for 'Original Interactive Program' (see links).</p>

<h3>User Experience and Interface Design</h3>

<p>Due to the use of different platforms, each platform does not particularly make a strong attempt to customise its look/cannot customise its look, but overall appears to use predefined themes and therefore is only as accessible as the theme chosen or the website itself. This makes it more realistic, as it is a practice most people would engage in and most people are familiar with seeing such an interface thus meshes nicely with our target audience.</p>

<p>The quality of the Youtube content is high and although the sound quality was not as good in the beginning, cleaned up through the duration of the series. Although Youtube provides Closed Captioning, this does not always appear to work well and often results in strange text printed, which would be an issue for accessibility. As the series is aimed at young Americans predominately, the series being mainly English is not a problem, however makes it less accessible, presumably, to non-English speakers from other countries.</p>

<p>Photos posted by characters throughout the series and shared via the social media platforms bring the story to life and gives the series a sense of character. Characters also share an array of user generated content, however (mentioned above), and reply to viewers' comments therefore making the experience highly interactive as the audience community is involved and integrated into this fictional world yet at the same time can interact with the actors also.</p>

<p>Because of the storyline where the characters have gone on to pursue their lives elsewhere and 'closed the chapter' these social media accounts do not continue to engage with audiences, but anyone new to the series can go backwards in time to see everything that was posted and engage with the story further. Some characters from the story continue progressing onwards, such as 'Gigi Darcy' from <em>LBD</em> has been adapted to playing the titular character from Austen's unfinished novel, Sanditon, and thus in this respect continues interaction of this series, but only in the context of that storyline.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p><em>LBD</em> is a highly creative, meticulously planned and deeply integrated adaptation of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> which I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of watching, although am disappointed I missed out on the interactive aspect of it, even though the official show pages still update frequently. In my opinion, the creators and producers of this series achieved their aim incredibly well of creating a unique interactive work that brought <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> to a modern audience, yet still upholding important ideals and empowering women rather than degrading them in an important twist.</p>

<p>As the series is long (110 episodes, plus perhaps 40-50 from the other video channels), it really requires dedication of time to in order to complete, but because it is such an engaging experience, this certainly does not seem like such a time-intense task and rather you become too engaged to stop and continually want to find out more.</p>

<p>The reason I chose this project in the first place was due to being impressed by the amount of planning that went into this work, as well as the excellent writing and acting which made this series happen. The integration of this content has been excellent, the continual consistency of the story and the consistency of quality content along with the occasional realistic touch to the videos (occasionally a depletion of sound or image quality depending on the environment) in addition to the community that has built up around this work made the experience a pleasure and a series which I would recommend to anyone who had not seem it before.</p>
