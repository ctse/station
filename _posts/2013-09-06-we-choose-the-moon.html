<p>This is another site that came out of a different subject, but it's interesting that so many of the works that I've seen to be Multiplatform and that have been introduced in class so far all appear to have some basis in Adobe Flash. Adobe Flash is truly an interactive medium so this makes sense, however with the emergence of CSS3 and HTML5 being interactive also, with the added mix of JavaScript, one would imagine there are more sites that use this to their advantage - perhaps I'm simply not looking in the right place? Of course there are examples that are simply HTML based.</p>

<p>In any case, <a href="http://www.wechoosethemoon.org/">http://www.wechoosethemoon.org/</a> was a site that was linked in another subject as using Adobe Flash to tell a story. I noticed that on the side, there was a "Mission Transmission" box, and when clicked, it took me to a <a href="https://twitter.com/AP11_CAPCOM">Twitter</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/AP11_SPACECRAFT">feed</a>. The site in itself already utilises a mix of pictures, video and audio from the Apollo 11 mission. Although these accounts weren't used to interact with others, quite obviously this 'mission' could be followed on social media by any interested parties.</p>

<p>This site has already been up since 2009, it would be interesting to see if there can be more uncovered about the launch of this website (not the spacecraft)!</p>
