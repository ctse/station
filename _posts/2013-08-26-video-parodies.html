<p>While searching up webseries in the past week to continue research on, <a href="http://shortyawards.com/HillywoodShow">the Hillywood Show popped up on the Shorty Awards website</a> and reminded me of the Twilight Parody they did which I watched years ago. There were a lot of other ones too, but it strikes me that if Fanfiction can be an example of multiplatform storytelling, any of these series that have made it onto the internet, in any form have now become so as well.</p>

<p>Other examples are such as the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qzxoUSrZuU&list=PL3B8939169E1256C0">'How X should have ended' videos by HISHE</a>.</p>
