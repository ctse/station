<p>When discussing the second assignment in the last class this week, I went back to <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:No_Cost_or_Freedom%3F">Gutenberg</a> to look at what titles were available that I could perhaps use as the storyline for my second assignment. Adapting one of these stories would take some effort, especially as they are set in the past (hence why they are free now as their copyright has expired), but this would potentially save me effort in coming up with a totally new storyline, especially while the archives that were once available from the ABC are no longer.</p>

<p>In one of the classes, I'd pondered using <em>Black Beauty</em>, but anthropomorphism as well as bringing the novel to the current century would be quite difficult, though now that I think about it, perhaps if rather than an animal, 'Black Beauty' was technology of some sort, perhaps this idea would work.</p>

<p>In any case, in researching ways of delivering the story also, I'd remembered <a href="http://vndb.org/v/all">Visual Novels</a>, particularly the kind which the Japanese like to make. I've played many and I particularly like making 'choose your own adventure' stories, although I don't know how this might work with an adaptation of a story like <em>Black Beauty</em>. It would be an interesting, concept, however. Perhaps a more linear story might be involved with a story like <em>Black Beauty</em>, but with installments that are released every period, and social media interaction in between. Visual novels are known to be released in different 'Acts', usually with the first as a Demo.</p>

<p><a href="http://kirishimaayama.livejournal.com/43510.html">This link goes to a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' story I wrote in the past.</a> Although there are only four paths to four conclusions, it was my first attempt at this that I was extremely pleased with because I wanted all the stories to flow completely well with the introduction. They would not seem like four endings, but each one would seem like the proper ending for the story. Yet all four endings together would make a story also.</p>

<p>Some food for thought.</p>
